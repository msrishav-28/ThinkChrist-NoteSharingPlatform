## Running Migrations

### Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
supabase db push

# Reset database and apply all migrations
supabase db reset
```

### Using the Migration Script
```bash
# Run the enhancement migration
node scripts/run-migration.js
```

### Manual Application
If you need to apply the migration manually, execute the SQL files in order using your preferred database client.

## Post-Migration Steps

1. **Verify Tables**: Check that all new tables are created in your Supabase dashboard
2. **Test RLS Policies**: Ensure proper access controls are working
3. **Update Application Code**: Use the new `DatabaseUtils` class for enhanced operations
4. **Populate Default Data**: Consider adding default user preferences for existing users

## Rollback Considerations

The enhancement migration is designed to be backward compatible:
- Existing file upload functionality continues to work
- New columns have sensible defaults
- Optional fields don't break existing queries

However, if rollback is needed:
1. Remove the new tables (collections, user_preferences, user_interactions, notifications)
2. Remove the new columns from the resources table
3. Restore original constraints on file-related columns

## Development Notes

- All new tables include `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
- Automatic triggers maintain `updated_at` fields
- User preferences are automatically created for new users
- The schema supports future enhancements and extensions
